abstract class Commit {
  /// Commit moves indexed documents from the intermediate uncompressed data structure (array lists/HashMap, queryable by realtime search) in RAM
  /// to the final compressed data structure (roaring bitmap) on Mmap or disk -
  /// which is persistent, more compact, with lower query latency and allows search with realtime=false.
  /// Commit is invoked automatically each time 64K documents are newly indexed as well as on close_index (e.g. server quit).
  /// There is no way to prevent this automatic commit by not manually invoking it.
  /// But commit can also be invoked manually at any time at any number of newly indexed documents.
  /// commit is a **hard commit** for persistence on disk. A **soft commit** for searchability
  /// is invoked implicitly with every index_doc,
  /// i.e. the document can immediately searched and included in the search results
  /// if it matches the query AND the query paramter realtime=true is enabled.
  /// **Use commit with caution, as it is an expensive operation**.
  /// **Usually, there is no need to invoke it manually**, as it is invoked automatically every 64k documents and when the index is closed with close_index.
  /// Before terminating the program, always call close_index (commit), otherwise all documents indexed since last (manual or automatic) commit are lost.
  /// There are only 2 reasons that justify a manual commit:
  /// 1. if you want to search newly indexed documents without using realtime=true for search performance reasons or
  /// 2. if after indexing new documents there won't be more documents indexed (for some time),
  ///    so there won't be (soon) a commit invoked automatically at the next 64k threshold or close_index,
  ///    but you still need immediate persistence guarantees on disk to protect against data loss in the event of a crash.
